        <h1>First And Last</h1>
        <p>"This is what the Lord says—
            Israel’s King and Redeemer, the Lord Almighty:
        I am the first and I am the last;
            apart from me there is no God".</p><br>
        <h5>Isaiah 44:6</h5><br><br>
        <p>When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.</p>
